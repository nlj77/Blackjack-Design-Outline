# Blackjack-Design-Outline
This is a assignment for SMT's dev training. The goal of the assignment is to learn more about designing a project. 

**Overview**
<p> In the game of Blackjack, a player's goal is to accept dealt cards, in order to achieve a sum total of 21 or as close to it, without exceeding 21. If a player has reached 21, either by hitting or recieving 21 in total on an initial deal, or the player has reached a sum total that tops out their risk tolerance, the dealer then tries to reach 21, or a total better than the player's holding total, but no greater than 21. Betting is required, and if a player 'busts', they forfeit the money in the pot.</p>
